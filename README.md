# FriendLuancher

FriendLuancher is an app which has been especially designed so that the elderly, blind or visually impaired people, etc. find it easier to use smartphones. Simple menus accessible to everyone, identifying and bold colours, big icons and a perfect font size for a perfect display on any screen.

This launcher combines all the features of high-performance devices with the simplicity of a basic telephone. Its different colours make the app more accessible as the user can easily associate the symbol with the button. Thus, understanding a text is no longer important, which results in a more intuitive use of the device.
